原文: There are currently two LIRD paradigms used to damage photoreceptors in adult zebrafish. Constant exposure to bright light (~8,000 lux) is a widely used technique that causes photoreceptor loss in the dorsal half of the adult albino zebrafish retina within 24 hours of light onset (Vihtelic and Hyde, 2000; Vihtelic et al., 2006). This LIRD paradigm is based on the parameters previously shown to damage photoreceptors in the rodent (Noell et al., 1966; Wenzel et al., 2005). Adolescent albino mice show a peak of photoreceptor cell death at 36 hours after light onset (Wenzel et al., 2005), loss of photoreceptor inner and outer segments at 3 days (Yamashita et al., 1992), and severe outer nuclear layer (ONL) damage after 5 to 7 days of exposure (Yamashita et al., 1992). Both zebrafish and rodents exhibit significantly more photoreceptor damage in the superior half of the retina, which is analogous to the dorsal half of the adult zebrafish retina (Rapp and Williams, 1980). In addition, the constant bright light paradigm reportedly damages rod photoreceptors and leaves cone photoreceptors largely intact (Cicerone, 1976; La Vail, 1976; Thummel et al., 2010). More recently, a second LIRD paradigm has been used to cause photoreceptor apoptosis in adult zebrafish (Bernardos et al., 2007). This method uses a short exposure to an ultraviolet (UV) light source, which produces ~100,000 lux of light. 24 hours after a 30 min UV exposure, adult zebrafish show extensive damage to both rod and cone photoreceptors (Bernardos et al., 2007). However, this method reportedly causes the most damage to the central retina, surrounding the optic nerve, and a variable level of damage peripherally into the dorsal and ventral halves of the retina (Bernardos et al., 2007). Thus, this LIRD paradigm can damage both rod and cone photoreceptors, but results in areas with widespread photoreceptor loss adjacent to areas with minimal damage (Bernardos et al., 2007).

原文: To quantify the regeneration response at 48 hours after light onset, analysis of band intensity on immunoblots was performed from protein collected from 48 hLt, 48 hpUV, and UV+48 hLt retinas. Protein from 48 hour post fertilization (hpf) embryos and untreated retinas (0 hr) were used for controls. Significant reduction in Zpr-1 expression was observed between the 0 hour and 48 hour timepoints under all three light treatments (Fig. 5A and B, Table 3), representing the loss of double cone photoreceptors. These data are consistent with Zpr-1 immunolocalization on light-treated retinas, in which UV+48 hLt retinas exhibited the fewest numbers of double cone photoreceptors of all three light treatments (Fig. 2Y and Z, Table 2). Immunoblot analysis also revealed significant differences in cell cycle markers between the various light treatments (Fig. 5A, Table 3). PCNA expression levels significantly increased from 0 hr→48 hLt→48 hpUV→UV+48 hLt (Fig. 5A and B, Table 3), which is consistent with PCNA immunolocalization in these retinas (Fig. 4). Expression of Cyclin H and two Cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk-1 and Cdk-2, were also analyzed. Cyclin H binds Cdk-7 to form a Cdk-Activating Kinase (CAK) (Fesquet et al., 1993). CAK regulates cell cycle progression by phosphorylating, and thus activating, certain cyclindependent protein kinases, including Cdk-1 and Cdk-2 (Devault et al., 1992; Fesquet et al., 1993; Gu et al., 1992). Each light treatment resulted in increased Cyclin H expression (Fig. 5A, Table 3). Two bands were observed for Cdk-1 and Cdk-2, representing different states of phosphorylation for each protein (Jamil et al., 2005; Watanabe et al., 1999).

原文: Recent advancements allow for the expression of a specific gene of interest to be knocked down during retinal regeneration (Fausett et al., 2008; Thummel et al., 2008b). This has revealed a small number of genes that are required for Müller glial cell proliferation and the subsequent amplification of Müller glia-derived retinal progenitors (Fausett et al., 2008; Ramachandran et al., 2010; Ramachandran et al., 2011; Thummel et al., 2010; Thummel et al., 2008a). It is possible that the genetic pathways that underlie these early steps of Müller glial cell activation and proliferation are conserved regardless of which retinal cell type is damaged. However, the later stages of progenitor cell migration and differentiation are inherently dependent on what cell type is being regenerated. For example, determining whether a particular gene of interest is required for rod vs. cone cell regeneration has proven difficult when using the constant bright light paradigm, because this model damages significantly more rods than cones (Qin et al., 2011; Thummel et al., 2010). Given the complex cellular events observed in regenerating specific retinal neurons, including proliferation, migration and differentiation, it is likely that different genetic pathways are required for the selective regeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors (Morris et al., 2011; Morris et al., 2008; Morris et al., 2005; Qin et al., 2011; Thummel et al., 2010). Thus, there is a need to establish a LIRD paradigm that achieves consistent damage to both rod and cone photoreceptors and widespread photoreceptor damage throughout the retina. Minimally, if data from these different LIRD paradigms can be interpreted, a clear analysis of the regional differences in photoreceptor loss that are observed in each of these models must be performed.

原文: Here we show that both the ventral and posterior regions of the retina are protected from light damage. It was previously reported that the dorsal (or superior) retina in adult albino zebrafish is more susceptible to light damage than the ventral (inferior) retina (Vihtelic et al., 2006). This is consistent with reports in the rodent, which show more severe damage to the superior half of the retina (Rapp and Williams, 1980). Many possibilities could account for this finding, with the main hypothesis being that Rhodopsin is the trigger for photoreceptor cell death (Grimm et al., 2000; Humphries et al., 1997; Noell et al., 1966). Thus, reduced photoreceptor damage in the ventral/inferior retina was attributed to shorter

The Tg(gfap:egfp)/alb transgenic line was used to visualize EGFP-positive Müller glial (Thummel et al., 2008b). To visualize Müller glial proliferation during the various light treatments, the Tg(gfap:egfp)/alb retinas were co-labeled with Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), an established marker for the G1/S transition (Thummel et al., 2006;

原文: ROS, and thus, lower levels of Rhodopsin. Similar to the rodent, zebrafish also have shorter ROS in the inferior/ventral half of the retina (Fig. 1, Vihtelic et al, 2006), which may also account for the dorsal/ventral differences observed in light-damaged zebrafish retinas (Figs. 1 and 2, Vihtelic et al., 2006). However, there are no reports indicating that the posterior half of the zebrafish retina possesses fewer rod photoreceptors or shorter ROS. Further, analysis of flatmounted retinas (Fig. 6–8) indicated similar amounts of EGFP-positive RIS in untreated retinas (Fig. 8), suggesting that differences in Rhodopsin levels likely does not account for the anterior/posterior differences observed in light-treated retinas. Another possibility for the regional differences is differential expression of neuroprotective factors, such as FGF-2 (Li et al., 2003; Liu et al., 1998; Stone et al., 1999). FGF-2 expression was reportedly higher in the inferior half of the rodent retina compared with the superior half (Stone et al., 1999). Given that FGF-2 protects photoreceptors from light damage in both rodents (Faktorovich et al., 1990, 1992; LaVail et al., 1991) and zebrafish (Qin et al., 2011), this may contribute to the regional differences observed in light-treated retinas. Although it is not known whether FGF-2 is differentially expressed in the adult zebrafish retina, FGF-2 was recently reported to regulate rod photoreceptor cell maintenance in adult zebrafish (Qin et al., 2011). A final possibility for the regional differences observed in light susceptibility is that photoreceptors in the both halves of the retina develop differently due to the animals being reared in environments with overhead lighting. When rodents are raised in animal facilities with room lighting at the side of the animals, rather than above the animals, the protection of the inferior retina was lost (Stone et al., 1999). Although it is unclear whether this is also the case in adult zebrafish, this would not account for the anterior/posterior differences observed in light-treated zebrafish retinas, since they are at the same level relative to the overhead lights. Therefore, it is currently unclear what accounts for the heretofore unrecognized protection of the posterior zebrafish retina.

译文: 活性氧（ROS），因此，视紫红质水平较低。与啮齿动物类似，斑马鱼在视网膜的下侧/腹侧也具有较短的ROS（图1，Vihtelic et al, 2006），这也可能解释观察到的光损伤斑马鱼视网膜的背侧/腹侧差异（图1和图2，Vihtelic et al., 2006）。然而，没有报道显示斑马鱼视网膜的后半部分具有较少的杆光感受器或较短的ROS。此外，对平铺视网膜的分析（图6–8）表明在未处理的视网膜中EGFP阳性的RIS数量相似（图8），这表明视紫红质水平的差异可能不足以解释在光处理视网膜中观察到的前/后差异。区域差异的另一种可能性是神经保护因子的表达差异，如FGF-2（Li et al., 2003；Liu et al., 1998；Stone et al., 1999）。据报道，FGF-2在啮齿动物视网膜下半部的表达高于上半部（Stone et al., 1999）。考虑到FGF-2在啮齿动物（Faktorovich et al., 1990, 1992；LaVail et al., 1991）和斑马鱼（Qin et al., 2011）中保护光感受器免受光损伤，因此这可能有助于解释在光处理视网膜中观察到的区域差异。虽然目前尚不清楚FGF-2是否在成年斑马鱼视网膜中表现出差异性表达，但最近有报道指出FGF-2调节成年斑马鱼杆光感受器细胞的维持（Qin et al., 2011）。观察到的光敏感性区域差异的最后一种可能性是，由于动物在有顶灯的环境中饲养，视网膜两半的光感受器发育存在差异。当啮齿动物在动物设施中被侧向照明而不是从上方照明时，腹侧视网膜的保护作用会丧失（Stone et al., 1999）。虽然目前尚不清楚成年斑马鱼是否也存在这种情况，但这无法解释在光处理斑马鱼视网膜中观察到的前/后差异，因为它们在顶灯的相对高度上处于同一水平。因此，目前尚不清楚是什么导致了后斑马鱼视网膜尚未被认知的保护作用。

原文: To test whether various light treatments resulted in differences in rod photoreceptor damage, the Tg(nrd:egfp)/alb transgenic line was used to visualize rod photoreceptor cell somas in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), rod inner segments (RIS), and rod outer segments (ROS). Untreated (0 hr) fish showed EGFP-positive rod photoreceptors throughout the dorsal and ventral halves of the retina (Fig. 1A and C, respectively). At 48 hours of constant bright light (48 hLt), rod photoreceptor loss was evident in both the dorsal and ventral halves of the retina (Fig. 1B and D, respectively). As was previously reported in both rodents and zebrafish, the dorsal retina appeared to suffer more damage than the ventral retina (compare Fig 1B with Fig. 1D). Compared with 48 hLt retinas, UV exposure resulted in visibly fewer rod photoreceptors in both the dorsal and ventral halves of the retina 48 hours after light onset (48 hpUV) (Fig. 1E and G, respectively). EGFP-positive cellular debris was present in the degenerated ROS and RIS in the dorsal half of 48 hpUV retinas (Fig. 1E), whereas intact ROS and RIS were visible in the ventral half of 48 hpUV retinas (Fig. 1G). Combining UV exposure with 48 hours of constant bright light (UV+48hLt) resulted in the greatest amount of damage to both the dorsal and ventral halves of the retina (Fig. 1F and H, respectively). Very few rod photoreceptor somas and RIS were observed in the dorsal half of UV+48 hLt retinas, and the ROS was completely absent (Fig. 1F). Notably, extensive damage to the ROS and RIS was also visualized in the ventral half of UV+48 hLt retinas. (Fig. 1H).

译文: 为了测试各种光照处理是否导致杆状光感受器损伤的差异，使用了Tg(nrd:egfp)/alb转基因线来可视化外核层(ONL)中的杆状光感受器细胞胞体、杆状内段(RIS)和杆状外段(ROS)。未处理（0小时）的鱼在视网膜的背面和腹面部分均显示EGFP阳性的杆状光感受器（图1A和C，分别）。在持续亮光下48小时（48 hLt），视网膜的背面和腹面部分均出现明显的杆状光感受器损失（图1B和D，分别）。正如之前在啮齿动物和斑马鱼中报告的那样，背侧视网膜似乎比腹侧视网膜受到更多损伤（比较图1B与图1D）。与48 hLt视网膜相比，UV照射在光照开始48小时后（48 hpUV）在视网膜的背面和腹面部分均明显减少了杆状光感受器（图1E和G，分别）。在48 hpUV视网膜的背面部分，退化的ROS和RIS中存在EGFP阳性细胞碎片（图1E），而在48 hpUV视网膜的腹面部分可以看到完整的ROS和RIS（图1G）。将UV照射与48小时的持续亮光（UV+48hLt）结合导致了视网膜的背面和腹面部分受到最大的损伤（图1F和H，分别）。在UV+48 hLt视网膜的背面部分观察到极少的杆状光感受器胞体和RIS，ROS完全缺失（图1F）。值得注意的是，在UV+48 hLt视网膜的腹面部分也观察到ROS和RIS的广泛损伤。（图1H）。
